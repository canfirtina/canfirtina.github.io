I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu). I lead the [STORM Research Group](https://storm.cs.umd.edu). My research focuses on algorithms and systems for bioinformatics.

My interests span bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and computer architecture. I am excited to work on a broad range of problems to address fundamental challenges in computer science, life sciences, and medicine. To this end, I design methods and build systems that use emerging computing paradigms and memory technologies to enable fast, accurate, energy-efficient, and real-time analysis of genomic and other biological data. I am also interested in developing solutions for applications such as genome editing.

Previously, I was a Senior Researcher and Lecturer at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I taught courses on [accelerating genome analysis with hardwareâ€“algorithm co-design](https://safari.ethz.ch/projects_and_seminars/spring2025/doku.php?id=bioinformatics). Lecture videos and materials are fully available on YouTube. I received my PhD from ETH Zurich, where I was advised by [Prof. Onur Mutlu](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/) in the [SAFARI Research Group](https://safari.ethz.ch). I received my MSc and BSc in [Computer Engineering](https://cs.bilkent.edu.tr) from Bilkent University.

**Prospective Students:** I am actively recruiting motivated students at multiple levels for my group. If you are interested in working with me, please contact me via [email](mailto:canfirtina@gmail.com).
